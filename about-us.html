		<h1>About Plumbing Solutions</h1>
<p>Plumbing Solutions is a full service plumbing company, with over sixteen (16) years experience in all aspects of residential and commercial plumbing installation and repairs. We are a proven leader in the plumbing industry in Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Our business model includes the provision of plumbing services in the maintenance and construction sectors, along with the retail and wholesale of a number of the leading international brands of sanitary ware, faucets and fittings.</p>
<p>In 1992, G.C.I. Sprinkler Systems was established in Trinidad to supply and install customized automatic irrigation systems, for lawns and gardens. Our first residential system was installed that year, while our first commercial installation was at the Coco Reef Resort &amp; Spa in Tobago in 1994. To date we have installed in excess of sixty-five complete irrigation systems for various applications.</p>
<p>In 1996, we recognized that there was a need locally for a more professional plumbing service in Trinidad and Tobago, and as a result, we diversified and entered this field as Plumbing Solutions. Initially, we started with one vehicle and one plumber, and to date we have grown to employ the services of over sixty-five members of staff.</p>
<p>Our maintenance department is staffed with highly trained and well equipped technicians, who provide excellent customer service and attends to approximately 160-190 jobs which are called in monthly. Our services include repairs from minor issues to major problems, which affect all sanitary fixtures and fittings, along with water pumps, water tanks and water heaters. Our specialized sewer division is equipped to clear, camera inspect and record minor to major sewer blockages and chokes. We do provide an on call service, 24 hours a day 7 days a week.</p>
<p>Our fleets of vehicles are equipped with radio communication, and are GPS tracked. Our dispatch and invoicing systems are fully computerized, and we have relied on the latest technologies in the plumbing industry to set the standards for our service.</p>
<p>Some of Plumbing Solutions regular maintenance customers include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Beacon Insurance Company Limited</li>
<li>Ernst &amp; Young</li>
<li>Sagicor General</li>
<li>Price Waterhouse Cooper</li>
<li>F.T. Farfan &amp; Sons</li>
<li>Caribbean Chemicals</li>
<li>Comfort Engineering</li>
<li>Royal Castle</li>
<li>Queens Park Cricket Club</li>
<li>Dairy Distributors</li>
<li>Stanmore Properties</li>
<li>N.I.P.D.E.C.</li>
</ol>
<p>Initially in 1996 our intention was to focus our plumbing services to the maintenance sector. However, as our clientele base expanded, the demand for our services in the plumbing construction sector increased. Over the years our plumbing construction services have ranged from small residential construction, to some of the largest commercial plumbing projects in Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada and St Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>
<p>Our employees, our desire to succeed, and our commitment to excellence, have allowed the word of our professional service and quality works to spread. The demands for our quality plumbing services have been overwhelming at times. While we have taken the decision to allow controlled, well managed growth, due to the nature of this business, we have taken every step to ensure that our technicians and management are well trained and organized to meet the demands of our ever increasing market share.</p>
<p>Our construction department boasts of two licensed sanitary constructors who have an excellent working relationship with the Water &amp; Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago. Our project managers and supervisors are amongst the brightest in the industry, and our team of foremen and technicians are well trained, efficient and courteous.</p>
<p>Our in house design department will attain W.A.S.A. approvals for all wastewater on-lot system designs, along with swimming pool and spa designs. All plumbing drawings and layouts, including waste and water isometrics are provided, and we do offer the service of producing shop drawings and as built drawings.</p>
<p>Over the past sixteen (16) years Plumbing Solutions has had the pleasure of working on many construction projects in Trinidad and Tobago, and the Caribbean. Some of the larger projects which we have provided our complete plumbing service for are:</p>

<p>To ensure a professional service we realized that we must use quality products. Over the years we have partnered with a number of international suppliers of quality plumbing products. At present we supply all of our plumbing products from our network of suppliers around the globe. It is through these contacts that we are able to supply an extensive range of materials and equipment, within a short period of time, at reasonable prices which benefit our clients.</p>
<p>Our every day inventory includes most of the items needed to repair most of the plumbing problems. Our inventory is replenished in advance of shortages, and we are constantly reviewing trade publications and attending trade shows to learn about the most revolutionary products in our industry.</p>
<p>In December 2003, our affiliate, Bath &amp; Kitchen Design Center was opened at # 41 Mucurapo Road, St. James. This Center is successfully managed by Desiree Alexander, who is certified in Project Management and Interior Design. At this location we currently display a complete line of American Standard and Kohler sanitary ware and fittings, as well as Decolav, Duravit, Sloan, Zurn, Bemis, Armitage Shanks, Mr. Direct and other plumbing products which we represent.</p>

Through these local organizations we have gained a better understanding of the local construction industry, along with the local business sector. We have also been able to promote the benefits of being a professional to our counterparts.</p>
<p>As a member of the World Plumbing Council we are better educated about the needs of the world’s population, who struggle with a limited source of drinking water. Plumbing Solutions also subscribes to the Council’s philosophy that sustainable health is not possible without access to safe drinking-water and basic sanitation facilities. The Council aims, to promote the plumbing industry’s role, in improving public health through the provision and protection of safe water and sanitation, safeguarding the environment through proper management, care, reuse, and conservation of natural resources.</p>
<p>Plumbing Solutions organized the launch of the World Plumbing Day in Trinidad and Tobago on March 9th 2012 and reconfirmed that “it is our intention to improve the standards and perception of the plumbing industry in Trinidad and Tobago, and the wider Caribbean. Plumbing Solutions takes water efficiency and preservation seriously, and promotes it to our customers, within their homes and businesses. We remain steadfast and committed in our role towards the health of our nation.”</p>
<p>We at Plumbing Solutions are very proud of our performance, our work ethic and our achievements over the past sixteen (16) years. We are extremely pleased to sustain a very high customer satisfaction rating. We are confident that with our willingness to learn, listen and provide excellent customer service, we will undoubtedly continue to be the leaders in the plumbing industry in this region.</p>
